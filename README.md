# Blackjack Game in Python
![Blackjack Project]()
## Project Overview
This project aims to create an interactive and user-friendly Blackjack game that runs in a Python environment. The game provides an authentic Blackjack experience, simulating the rules and strategies of the real-world card game.

## Features
**Deck Initialization:** The game starts by initializing a standard 52-card deck.

**Shuffling:** The deck is shuffled at the beginning of each round to ensure randomness.

**Betting System:** Players start with a certain amount of chips and can place bets within their chip limits.

**Dealer Logic:** The dealer follows standard Blackjack rules, hitting until they reach a total of 17 or higher.

**Player Choices:** Players can choose to 'Hit' for additional cards or 'Stand' to maintain their current total.

**End-Game Scenarios:** Win, loss, and tie scenarios are implemented, including chip gain or loss.

**Replay Option:** Players can choose to play another round or exit the game.

## Technologies Used
**Python:** The game is entirely written in Python, utilizing its standard libraries.

**Random Module:** Python's **'random'** library is used for shuffling the deck.
## How to Play
1. Run the Python script to start the game.
2. Place your bet for the round.
3. You and the dealer will be dealt two cards each.
4. Choose to 'Hit' or 'Stand' based on your current card total.
5. After your turn is over, the dealer reveals their hidden card and completes their hand.
6. The winner is determined based on the final card totals.
7. Choose to play another round or exit the game.
